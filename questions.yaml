    stage: quality_control
    text: "How many reads passed quality filtering in sample SRR25848640?"
    answer_type: integer_exact

  - id: q2
    stage: alignment
    text: "What was the percentage of reads mapped to the C. elegans genome in SRR25848640?"
    answer_type: numeric_percent
    tolerance: 0.5
