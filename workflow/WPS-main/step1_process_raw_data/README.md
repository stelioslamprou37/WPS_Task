# Processing raw data with dolphinNext (_Via Foundary_)

The raw data processing of WPS uses a user-friendly DolphinNext pipeline. Please refer to [Running the pipeline](https://github.com/XuhangLi/cellSeq_Pipeline/tree/dev) for instructions. We provided instructions for both running using cloud service provided by _Via Foundary_ or locally through installing a docker image and NextFlow.
